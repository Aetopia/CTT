> This is a repository for managing the [CTT discord server](http://dsc.gg/CTT)'s documentation more than it is a pre-baked solution like my other projects such as [Smoothie](https://github.com/couleur-tweak-tips/Smoothie) or [TweakList](https://github.com/couleur-tweak-tips/TweakList).


### üó∫Ô∏è **The plan**
- Each YAML file (could also be .JSON) is converted via a script into a Markdown file
- The webhook URLs are stored in the GitHub secrets, which are then pushed to the channel/edited.
