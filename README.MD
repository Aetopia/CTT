**Warning**
This is a repository for managing CTT more than it is a pre-baked solution like [Smoothie](https://github.com/couleur-tweak-tips/Smoothie) or [TweakList](https://github.com/couleur-tweak-tips/TweakList)

still wip, if someone is into managing discord webhooks with bots [dm](http://dsc.gg/CTT) or make an issue

#### what im planning to do

1. Each .md markdown file is parsed by the parser (wrote in Powershell) and converts them to a JSON file (which exists temporarily in the CI)
2. The webhook URLs are decrypted via the GPG key that's stored in the repo's secrets
3. gg
