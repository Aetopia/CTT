### ‚ö†Ô∏è**Warning**
This is a repository for managing the [CTT discord server](http://dsc.gg/CTT) more than it is a pre-baked solution like my other projects such as [Smoothie](https://github.com/couleur-tweak-tips/Smoothie) or [TweakList](https://github.com/couleur-tweak-tips/TweakList), though feel free to fork and fiddle around with it üòã


### üó∫Ô∏è **The plan**
*probably easier said than done lmao*
- Each .md markdown file is parsed by the parser (wrote in Powershell) and converts them to a discord embed, formatted as a JSON file (which exists temporarily in the CI)
- The webhook URLs are decrypted via the GPG key that's stored in the repo's secrets, then pushed to the channel.
