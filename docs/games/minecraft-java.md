## :fontawesome-solid-moon: **Clients**
Optimising Minecraft is relatively simple; you should start by downloading a client. A reputable and widely known client for Minecraft is [*Lunar Client*](<https://www.lunarclient.com/download>). However, if you aim only to PVP and play on versions 1.8.9 and 1.7.10, then you could look into [*CheatBreaker*](<https://cheatbreaker.net/>), a client owned and maintained by one of the [*CTT*](https://discord.gg/ctt) managers, Tellinq.

After you’ve downloaded one of these clients, you should turn most, if not all, visual models off. You can keep the desirable ones like FPS, Toggle-Sprint, Saturation, etc.
## :material-information: **Important Settings**:
:simple-render: **Fast Render**: This option should be enabled at all times as it gives a great increase to your fps and is the most impactful setting when it comes to performance, but this setting renders (pun intended) Shaders, Motion Blur, and Menu Blur unusable.

:material-cloud: **Custom Sky**: This option disables the custom sky added by some texture packs; depending on preference, you should have this off or on. With it off, you get a little fps boost.

:material-map-marker-distance: **Render Distance**: For mini-games like Duels, you want your render distance ideally on 4, but anything between 3 and 8 is ideal.

:material-image-size-select-large: **Resolution**: If you don’t have a computer that can handle high fps recording at a native resolution, you can try a [resolution](https://link.to.resolution.in.ctt.wiki) **lower** than your display's native resolution, as this can provide a huge FPS boost.

:fontawesome-solid-flask: **Smooth FPS**: Enabling this setting will lower performance of the game while lowering the GPU usage of Minecraft; this will lower [Encoding Lag](https://link.to.EncodingLag.in.ctt.wiki) by allowing [OBS](../video/obs/index.md) to use more resources.

## :simple-amp: **Mods**
