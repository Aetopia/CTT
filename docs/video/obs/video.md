# Difference between Base (Canvas) and Output (Scaled) resolutions

As canvas implies, it's the resolution of the preview pane where you place sources/

The output takes the base canvas and scales it to whatever you set it to.

### When using a different resolution is worth using

If you're limited on bandwidth / encoding efficiency you might consider scaling down, or the opposite on YouTube for extra bitrate (same principle as (up)scaling)

For recording it's not recommended to scale at all.

# Frame rate

All of us use <kbd>Fractional FPS Value</kbd>, and use `the fps we want` / `1`
