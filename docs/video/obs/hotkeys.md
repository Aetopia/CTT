If you put the same keybind on a start X and stop X / enable X and disable X it will work like a toggle.


* `Enable Preview` & `Disable Preview`

:   This helps with performance, I like to disable it after starting recording.

<!--
It definitely does help with performance - no need for 'may'
-->

* `Reset Stats`

:   Very underrated, when alt-tabbing there's always a few frames that drop, I like to reset it so I can check if it's above 0, instead of trying to remember how much there was before. 


## Replay Buffer

* `Save Replay`

:   If you want to save clips with the [Replay Buffer](./output.md) without having to alt tab and click on the little :material-download: button next to <kbd>Stop Replay Buffer</kbd>
