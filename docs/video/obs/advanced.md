    I'm not that knowledgeable regarding all the color formats, spaces and ranges, contributions welcome.

* `Color Format`: <kbd>NV12 (8-bit, 4:2:0, 2 planes)</kbd>

:   If you want super crisp colors you can try <kbd>I444</kbd>, normally NV2/I420 records color (chroma) planes at half the resolution of the light (luma) planes. Learn about more [:simple-wikipedia::Chrominance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrominance)

* `Color Space`: <kbd>sRGB</kbd>

* `Color Range`: <kbd>Limited</kbd>

:   <kbd>Full</kbd> tends to look a bit more saturated when converted around, which some people like.
