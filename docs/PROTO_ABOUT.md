### About /CTT

[``couleur-tweak-tips/CTT``](https://github.com/couleur-tweak-tips/CTT) is a special repository on my organization which is meant to take care of a few things:

<:dot:869944366356107284>Back up documentation
<:dot:869944366356107284>Act as a place to collaborate on (git)
<:dot:869944366356107284>Updates webhooks
<:dot:869944366356107284>Converts webhooks in `/webhooks/` to markdown, "mirrored" in `/docs/` (see repo above)

In layman's terms you could calll it an "Embed Management System"

If you're invited here you are invited to give a look and try it out for yourself :thumbsup:, and maybe fork it to use it for your own server :eyes: 

Requisites:
<:dot:869944366356107284>Working with embeds (e.g w/ <http://discohook.org>)
<:dot:869944366356107284>Pushing files to GitHub (To try it out make a Pull Request on the repo above, that can even be done from the browser)
