# Contribution Guidelines

Thank you for considering contributing, because of the increased complexity, markdown featuren, some clear rules need to be established

* **Have one specific goal per pull request**: Having a single big one means discussing everything at a single place (messy) and refusing some of what was modified means having to ask and have you revert the specific lines.

this is still kind of nebulous, will get more strict as time goes on üëç
