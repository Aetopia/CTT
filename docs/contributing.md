# Contribution Guidelines

This website was not made to thoroughly index and review every single available program under the sun, but instead hand-pick a couple that are worth recommending, though one or multiple "honorable mentions" categories at the bottom of a program's page is acceptable. 

You can contact us about your idea:

* <div class="annotate" markdown>Send your idea in the [CTT Discord](https://discord.gg/CTT)'s `#suggestions` forum or [in DMs](./contact.md#couleur)(1)</div>

    1.  If what you're writing is beyond Discord's 2000 character limit (4000 w/ nitro) make a [Cryptpad](https://cryptpad.fr/pad/) page


Or do most of the work by 

1. [Fork `couleur-tweak-tips/CTT` on GitHub](https://github.com/couleur-tweak-tips/CTT/fork) 

2. Contributing your fix / idea and [opening a pull request](https://github.com/couleur-tweak-tips/CTT/pulls)

:   Doing this implies you respect the following:

    * <u>Have one specific subject per pull request</u>: Having multiple things going on in one pull requests makes resolving modifying what is denied and keeping what's accepted challenging, stay concise and faithful to your pull request's name.
    * Do not leave placeholder links to pages that do not exist like ``[this](./placeholder/)``
