# Winget

Microsoft' command-line package manager for Windows

I don't use it much so I'll just recommend you reading the [MS docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/winget/)

## [winget.app](https://winstall.app/)

This noob-friendly lets you pick software to install and builds up a command for you to simply paste in cmd.

### Repos:
* [winget CLI tool](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli) (License: MIT)
* [winget packages (manifests)](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-pkgs) you need to drill down in /manifests/, [here's an example](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-pkgs/tree/master/manifests/m/Microsoft/PowerShell/7.3.8.0)
